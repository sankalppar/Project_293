# Mandelbrot Zoom
This repository contains the project I did as part of my CS293 course under Prof. Bhaskaran Raman.
In this project I have plotted the mandelbrot set with zoom functionality using SFML library in C++.
Use cmake .. in build directory to create the makefile and then make to build.
Finally run it by using ./mandelbrot
Use Left mouse click to zoom in and right mouse click to zoom out.
