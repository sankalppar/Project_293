# Mandelbrot Zoom
This repository contains the project I did as part of my CS293 course under Prof. Bhaskaran Raman.
In this project I have plotted the mandelbrot set with zoom functionality using SFML library in C++.
Use cmake .. in build directory to create the makefile and then make to build.
Finally run it by using ./mandelbrot
Use Left mouse click to zoom in and right mouse click to zoom out.
Further you can use arrow keys to navigate around.
Use any number from 2-9 to zoom in that number of times automatically without giving a point.
Use 0 to zoom in 10 times.
Use R, G or B to set the primary color to Red, Green or Blue respectively.
Important : You need to install SFML Library first so that you can run the program.
            You can run install.sh to install the library in ubuntu.
